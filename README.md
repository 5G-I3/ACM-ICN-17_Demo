## Code

### CCN-lite
We made modifications to CCN-lite (v1) to include our Publishâ€“Subscribe option.
The patch file that contains our modifications is provided in [ccn-lite.patch](ccn-lite.patch)
and needs to be applied onto cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite@7b973a737dba47fe6c1ee2d58e06dd9a22209fde.

### RIOT
We made modifications to RIOT to include the modified version of CCN-lite.
The patch file is provided in [RIOT.patch](RIOT.patch). Before applying the
patch file, both sections (PKG\_URL and PKG\_VERSION) in the file need to be adapted
to point to the modified CCN-lite version (i.e. after applying [ccn-lite.patch](ccn-lite.patch).
