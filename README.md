## Code

### CCN-lite
We made modifications to CCN-lite (v1) to include our Publishâ€“Subscribe option.
The patch file that contains our modifications is provided in [ccn-lite.patch](ccn-lite.patch)
and needs to be applied onto [cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite@7b973a737dba47fe6c1ee2d58e06dd9a22209fde](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite/commit/7b973a737dba47fe6c1ee2d58e06dd9a22209fde).

### RIOT
We made modifications to RIOT to include the modified version of CCN-lite.
The patch file is provided in [RIOT.patch](RIOT.patch) and needs to be applied onto
[RIOT-OS/RIOT@4a463c105db8b4a3b39cefc5784c25954fbac410](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/4a463c105db8b4a3b39cefc5784c25954fbac410).
Before applying the patch file, both sections (PKG\_URL and PKG\_VERSION) in
the file need to be adapted to point to the modified CCN-lite version (i.e. after applying [ccn-lite.patch](ccn-lite.patch)).
